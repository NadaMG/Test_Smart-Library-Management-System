Phase 1: The Blueprint (UML)
Before writing a single line of code, we’ll define the structure. We should create two main diagrams:

Class Diagram: To show the attributes and methods of Book, User, and Library.

Sequence Diagram: To show the logic of what happens when a user borrows a book.

Phase 2: The Implementation (Code)
We can write this in a language of your choice (Python, Java, or C++ are the most common for these case studies). We will focus on:

Encapsulation: Keeping data safe within classes.

Inheritance: Perhaps having different types of users (Librarian vs. Member).

Clean Code: Adding comments and meaningful variable names so recruiters love it.

Phase 3: The "GitHub Polish"
A project isn't "done" until the README.md looks professional. I can help you write a markdown file that includes:

A clear project description.

Instructions on how to run the code.

Embedded images of your UML diagrams.
